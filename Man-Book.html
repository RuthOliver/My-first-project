        <h3 class="section-title">What is the Booker Prize?</h3>
        <p>The Booker Prize for Fiction (formerly known as the Booker–McConnell Prize and the Man Booker Prize) is a
            literary prize awarded each year for the best original novel written in the English language and published
            in the United Kingdom. The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and
            success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade. From its inception, only
            novels written by Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to
            receive the prize; in 2014 it was widened to any English-language novel—a change which proved
            controversial.

            A high-profile literary award in British culture, the Booker Prize is greeted with anticipation and
            fanfare.It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the shortlist or
            even to be nominated for the "longlist".</p>
